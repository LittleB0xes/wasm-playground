# Let's play with WASM, by hand

But why ? 

I was always told that the wasm was not made to be written by hand, that you had to go through an intermediate language (like Rust, C, Go),

... 

Ok... But frankly, with a few tools and a good text editor, there must be a way to have a little fun, right?

This repo is a kind of diary of my trip with wasm, hands dirty


# A minimal setup
- A text editor
- Some tools to compile `.wat`file to `.wasm` file, like [WABT](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)
- Node
- And in some case, a local server to run the wasm in browser
